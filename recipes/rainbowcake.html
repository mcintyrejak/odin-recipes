    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For rainbow cake layers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Nonstick cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 (16.25 oz.) boxes white cake mix</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>6 large egs</li>
        <li>Gel food coloring in red, yellow, green, and blue</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For decorating</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 containers (about 3 cups) white or vanilla frosting</li>
        <li>About 2 cups rainbow sprinkles</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>For rainbow cake layers</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 deg F and spray your round cake pans with the nonstick cookings spray.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the cake mix, water, oil, and eggs. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed for 30
            seconds, then on medium speed for 2 minutes, scraping the bowl occasionally. Divide the batter evenly among
            5 bowls, about 1 1/3 cups of batter each.</li>
        <li>Using the food coloring, tint the batter in separate bowls. Start with a small amount of coloring, and
            adjust as needed.</li>
        <li>Pour each colored batter into separate cake pans. Set aside and cover the remaining batter until it's ready
            for use.</li>
        <li>Bake 25 to 30 minutes, or until cakes spring back when touched lightly in the center and begin to pull away
            from the side of the pan. Cool 10 minutes. Remove from pans to cooling racks and cool completely before
            frosting.</li>
        <li>Once the cakes have cooled completely, slice the domed tops with a sharp knife to flatten them. This will
            help
            you layer the cakes evenly.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>For decorating</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>With a flat spatula, evenly spread a thin layer of white frosting on your bottom cake layer. Top this cake
            with the remaining layers, spreading frosting between each.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of frosting over the entire cake. This is your "crumb coat" that holds everything
            together. Refrigerate the cake until firm, at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Spread the cake with the remaining frosting. Coat all over with rainbow sprinkles. Refrigerate until firm
            and ready to serve.</li>
    </ol>
